## 1. Equation Calculator

### Description
This program takes in user input to calculate simple equations. 
It then stores these equations and the answers to a .txt file which it later asks the user to rename.
It then asks the user to input this same name to open the file and read it's contents to the user.

### Installations
This program requires *Python* installed to run.
This program creates the .txt file and will be stored in the same folder as the python file.

## 2. Finance calculators

### Description
This program is a calculator designed to work out a bond repayment or investment return. 
There is the option to calculate investment as simple or compound.
This was my first capstone project.

### Installations
This program requires *Python* installed to run.

## 3. Holiday Calculator

### Description
This program calculates the cost of a holiday based on inputs of hotel price, nights stayed, days a car is rented and cost of flight.
It uses functions and while loops with if/else statements.
This was my first project using functions.

### Installations
This program requires *Python* installed to run.

## 4. Email

### Description
This program is an Email Simulator. Upon running it will create three sample emails which can be viewed and which will be marked as read once viewed.
This is my first project utilising the class function in Python.

### Installations
This program requires *Python* installed to run.

## 5. Task Manager

### Description
This program is a basic task manager. Admin and regular users can be added and deleted. Each user can be assigned tasks with due dates and these tasks can be edited by users. Reports can be generated by admins of users and tasks.
This is my first program utitilising my own functions in Python.

### Installations
This program requires *Python* installed to run.
Upon running the program, if the associated "txt" files do not exist in the same folder as the Python file, these "txt" files will be created.
